* Actions and Security Domains

All actions *must* to be explicitly defined before use.

Syntax:

actions[low] = [A1, A2, A3, ..., ]
actions[high] = [A4, A5, A6, ..., ]

This defines available actions for each security domain. Security domains are defined implicitly here too.

* Observations

Observations are defined either individually, or with a simple function.

Syntax:

obs(A1, low) = A1_observation
obs(A1, high) = A1_observation_high

or

obs(forall a, forall u) = ipurge(a, u)

Function syntax are followed below.

* States

States are not required to be defined; if they are not, then they are assumed to be permutations of all available actions.

However they can be defined optionally as follows:

Syntax:

states = [S1, S2, S3, S4, ..., ]

* Functions

Operations available:
(.) = Concatenation

Built-in functions:
  purge(action, domain)
  ipurge(action, domain)

* Security Domain Relationship

Syntax:

low >-> high

* Transitions

Transition is a simple function too. Either define explicitly:

step(S1, A1) = S2

or generally:

step(forall s, forall a) = s.a

* Comments

Start any line with -- and they are comments.

* Example

actions[high_1] = [H1]
actions[high_2] = [H2]
actions[down_1] = [D1]
actions[down_2] = [D2]
actions[low]    = [L]

-- implicit states = sequence of actions

obs(forall a, forall u) = ipurge(a, u)

high_1 >-> down_1
high_2 >-> down_2
down_1 >-> low
down_2 >-> low

step(forall s, forall a) = s.a
